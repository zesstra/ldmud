Some command-line flags were renamed to match the LPC defines they define
(#704):

*  --heart-interval -> --heart-beat-interval
*  --sync-heart     -> --synchronous-heart-beat
*  --async-heart    -> --asynchronous-heart-beat
*  --no-heart       -> --no-timers

For each port number more than one listening sockets may be opened (depending
on the number of interfaces and IP adresses the system has). However, the
maximum number of listening sockets is MAXNUMSOCKETS (from config.h). Once all
available slots are used, any remaining ports will be ignored.
